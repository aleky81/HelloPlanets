## Dog Seizure Tracker

This project includes a small Python script to keep track of your dog's seizures and medication doses. You don't need to know any programming to use it:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Go to this folder in the terminal.
4. Run `python dog_tracker.py`.
5. Pick an option from the menu to log a seizure, log a medication dose, or read the logs.

The information you enter will be saved in two files: `seizures.csv` and `medications.csv`.

## Web version

A basic web front end lives in the `docs/` folder. Open `docs/index.html` in a
browser to log seizures and medications. Everything is stored in your browser's
local storage.

### Deploy on GitHub Pages

To test the site online:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and select the `docs/`
   folder as the source.
3. After a few moments GitHub will give you a URL where the tracker is hosted.
